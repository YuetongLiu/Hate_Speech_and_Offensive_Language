# Hate_Speech_and_Offensive_Language

The development of network makes the spread and negative influence of hate speech break through the limitation of
region and time; however, it also provides a platform to detect and limit hate speech by artificial intelligence. In this
study, we will use skip-gram based word2vec method or n-gram with tfidf as vectorizers using PMI as an indicator to
realize feature selection. Then we use Word Count dictionary (LIWC) and LDA to complete our feature extraction
and apply logistic regression and support vector machine (SVM) as text classification techniques to develop a model
that can distinguish tweets containing hate speech key words into three categories (hate speech, offensive speech, and
normal speech).
